CS 200 - Module 01-02 Lab 2 Structured Webpage. The page is a single, valid, HTML5 page (index.html) that displays a Welcome (one top-level <h1>, and two links, an internal jump to #about-me and an external link to Vivid Racing in a new tab with rel=noopener noreferrer), an About Me section, a My Interests section, a skills aside with an aria-labelledby of skills, a Fun Fact article, a Favorite Quote aside with a <blockquote>, and a Figure with descriptive alt text and figure caption, all structured properly with <main>, < The CSS is all in-line in this page using some layered background images (dark linear-gradient overlay with an AE86 drift GIF), content-cards with variations in opacity using rgba(color) and backdrop-filter:blur(2px) and a prefers-reduced-motion: reduce media query that removes the animated background and sets background-attachment:scroll to avoid motion sickness. Please run index.html on any modern web browser or run locally (e.g., python -m http.server 8000 URL http://localhost:8000/). To update the background, change the GIF address inside the <style> block in <head> (you can save a local file assets/drift.gif and use it); In case the mobile is felt as janky when scrolling, change background-attachment: fixed, fixed; to scroll, scroll;. Future edits validation checklist: one and only one <html lang =en>, one and only one <title>, proper nesting/closing of semantic constructs, only one top-level <h1>, descriptive alt text on images, and has rel =noopener noreferrer whenever target =blank is set.
